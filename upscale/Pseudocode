For each grid cell in the dataset:
    If the cell is classified as a non-wetland water body (e.g., river, lake, pond, stream, reservoir):
        Exclude the cell from further analysis
    Else:
        Mark the cell as "wetland"

Use OpenCV's connectedComponentsWithStats to:
    Group all remaining wetland grid cells into spatially connected patches

For each modeled grid cell:
    Estimate the extent of wetland patches falling within the grid cell
    Calculate CH4_emission as:
        CH4_emission = CH4_flux_intensity Ã— wetland_extent
