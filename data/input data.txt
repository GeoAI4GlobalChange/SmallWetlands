The wetland dataset is from GWL_FCS30: https://zenodo.org/records/7340516  
For the input drivers, GPP was obtained from the GOSIF dataset, which is available at https://globalecology.unh.edu/data/GOSIF-GPP.html.  
Other variables (soil temperature, air temperature, air pressure, precipitation, wind speed, snow cover, and soil water content) were obtained from ERA5-land datasets,  
which are available at (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/derived-era5-land-daily-statistics).
